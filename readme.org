#+TITLE: Robust, randomized preconditioning for KRR


This repository contains code accompanying the paper [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12465][Robust, randomized precondinioning for kernel ridge regression]]. It includes simple implementations of the RPCholesky and KRILL preconditioners and scripts to run all the numerical experiments in the paper.

*Warning: the instructions assume that your current working directory is the base of this repository.*

* One-time setup
Consider creating a virtual enviroment for this project. For example, by running:
#+begin_src shell
$ python -m venv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
#+end_src

Then, install the requirements:
#+begin_src shell
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
#+end_src

* Downloading the data
To download the data for the performance plots run:
#+begin_src shell
$ cd utils
$ python download_data.py
#+end_src
Note that this will download and decompress several files and might take a while. All files will be saved in the =data= directory.

* Running experiments
In order to run the experiments you will need access to MATLAB. All the experiment scripts are in the =experiments= folders. After running the figures are saved in the =results= folder.

| *Script*                              | *Figures in the paper* |
| =exact_performance_test.m=            |              1 and 2 |
| =approximate_performance_test.m=      |              3 and 4 |
| =homo_restricted_subsampled_full.m=   |                    5 |
| =test_exact.m=                        |                    6 |
| =rpc_convergence_with_varying_rank.m= |                    7 |
| =susy_10k_centers.m=                  |                    8 |
| =lines_crossing.m=                    |                    9 |
