#+TITLE: Robust, randomized precondinioning for KRR

This repository contains code accompanying the paper [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12465][Robust, randomized precondinioning for kernel ridge regression]]. It includes simple implementations of the RPCholesky and KRILL preconditioners and scripts to run all the numerical experiments in the paper.

*Warning: the instructions assume that your current working directory is the base of this repository.*


* Downloading the data
To download the data for the performance plots run:
#+begin_src shell
$ cd utils
$ python experiments/download_data.py
#+end_src
Note that this will download and decompress several files and might take a while. All files will be saved in the =data= directory.

* Running experiments
In order to run the experiments you will need access to MATLAB.
